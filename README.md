# Etch-a-Sketch
Another one from The Odin Project.

The most fun I've had creating something yet. Learned about many new concepts such as callback functions, event handling, and a couple nifty CSS tricks. Furthered my understanding of loops, function scope, and finally starting to feel like I can grasp some concepts. Still seeking lots of help from forums and Chatbots, but am seeing progress in my understanding of where bugs are coming from.
